Create a rock, paper and scissors game with javascript.


How the game works? User inputs a value between 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissor'.
Them, the computer, using Math.random(), choose a number between 1 and 3, each nunbem is equivalent to a string value: 1 = rock, 2 = paper, 3 = scissors.  

After player and computer choose their number, the system compare the values and select a winner based in the rock, paper and scissors rules.

Each win is equal a one point, tie equals 0 point to both players and loss equals 1 point to the opponent.

This process repeat until one of them reach three points.
